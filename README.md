# -data-structure-project-longest-repeating-string-in-a-DNA-strand

While generating data from a processed DNA which has thousands of random combination of the A, T, G, C nucleotides, it become hard to know which part of the DNA has the maximum repetion. 

This program in general finds the longest repeating sequence of nucleotides that appears at least twice in the DNA strand.
