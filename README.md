# -data-structure-project-longest-repeating-string-in-a-DNA-strand

While generating data from a processed DNA which has thousands of random combination of the A, T, G, C nucleotides, it become hard to know which part of the DNA has the maximum repetion. 
If you open DNA.txt you can see the overwhelming combinations.

This program in project2.cpp in general finds the longest repeating sequence of nucleotides that appears at least twice in the DNA strand.

This project can be modelled in many different ways according to the need of the geneticists.
